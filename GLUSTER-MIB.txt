OwnerString ::= TEXTUAL-CONVENTION
    DISPLAY-HINT "255a"
    STATUS       deprecated
    DESCRIPTION
            "This data type is used to model an administratively
            assigned name of the owner of a resource.  This information
            is taken from the NVT ASCII character set.  It is suggested
            that this name contain one or more of the following: ASCII
            form of the manager station's transport address, management
            station name (e.g., domain name), network management
            personnel's name, location, or phone number.  In some cases
            the agent itself will be the owner of an entry.  In these
            cases, this string shall be set to a string starting with
            'agent'."

InterfaceIndexOrZero ::= TEXTUAL-CONVENTION
    DISPLAY-HINT "d"
    STATUS       current
    DESCRIPTION
            "This textual convention is an extension of the
            InterfaceIndex convention.  The latter defines a greater
            than zero value used to identify an interface or interface
            sub-layer in the managed system.  This extension permits the
            additional value of zero.  the value zero is object-specific
            and must therefore be defined as part of the description of
            any object which uses this syntax.  Examples of the usage of
            zero might include situations where interface was unknown,
            or when none or all interfaces need to be referenced."
